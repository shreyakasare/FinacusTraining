        <h1>Popular Programming Languages</h1>
        <p>C is the most widely popular programming language in TIOBE Index, while Python
            is the most searched language in PYPL Index. Python and Java closely follow
            Top-ranked C in TIOBE. In PYPL, a gap is wider as top-ranked Python has taken a lead 
            of over 12% from 2nd ranked Java.</p>

            <p><strong>TIOBE:</strong> Python has overtaken <span>Java</span> at 2nd position and is most
                likely to overtake top-ranked C because C is (just like Java) losing popularity. 
               These three languages are way ahead of others in TIOBE Index. C++ is at 4th while C# and
               Visual Basic .NET are very close to each other at 5th and 6th number. 
               <p class="highlight">Data Mining and AI languages are booming in the TIOBE index.</p>

                    Even old languages see a revival because 
                    of this, like the surge of Fortran. 
                    And, even more astonishing, 
                    we see Prolog re-entering the top 20 after 15 years... making an unexpected comeback. 
                    Prolog is used in IBM's Watson, one of the most well known AI engines.
                
                    Java, C and PHP have negative trends in the past years. PHP was at 3rd position in Mar 2010 is now at 8th. Positions of Java and C have not been much affected, but their ratings are constantly declining. The rating of Java has declined from 26.49% in June 2001 to 10.43% in Aug 2021 and C has declined from 20.24% in June 2001 to 12.57% in Aug 2021.

    <p><strong>PYPL:</strong> Acc to PYPL, which publishes separate ranking for five countries, 
        Python is the top language in all five countries (US, India, Germany, United Kingdom, 
        France). Python has ttaken a huge lead in these five countries over the 2nd number of Java,
         and its shares are even more than double of Java in Germany, United Kingdom, and France. 
         These top two account for almost half (48%) of the global search. Python has the highest 
        share in United Kingdom, close to 34%, and the lowest 31% in India.</p>
    
    PHP is the biggest loser in recent years. Its share was over 20% in 2008; now, this fig is only 5.76 % in 2021. Java is too declining but not as fast as PHP. Java's contribution was over 31% in 2008, and still, it holds 18%. In 2004-2009, 50% of the search was of either Java or PHP.
    
    <p><strong>TIOBE Index:</strong> TIOBE ratings are calculated by counting hits of the most 
        popular search engines. Twenty-five search engines are used to calculate the TIOBE index. 
        The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming 
        languages. The index started in the year 2001 and updated once a month.</p>
    
    <p><strong>PYPL Index:</strong> The PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Index is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google. The index is updated once a month.
